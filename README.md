Chronic kidney disease prediction using  Watson Auto AI
Existing Problem Survey: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated it in the early stages.Once any person gets kidney disease, they may suffer from the disease which may decrease their working capability as well as living quality.

Proposed Solution: In this proposed system we are able to identify the patients with disease.Our aim is Predict whether a person with specific Attributes/label is suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease or not. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease.
Developed a Machine Learning model to predict disease using IBM Watson AutoAI Machine Learning Service. The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be used as API in mobile app or web app building. Developed a web application which is built using node red service. We make use of the scoring end point to give user input values to the deployed model. The model prediction is then showcased on User Interface.

Technology Requirements : IBM Cloud,IBM Watson Auto AI, Node-Red
Functional Back-end Requirements :IBM Cloud, Watson Auto AI
Front-end Software Requirements : Node-Red

Outcome: Under the supervision of project mentor Successfully implemented Chronic kidney disease prediction strictly in accordance with the Specifications provided,and adhering to the time frame allocated. With Accuracy of 99.2% successfully predicted and detected persons suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease.
